                            <p>If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided.

                            <h3>3. Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
                            <p>InnoApps is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
        
                            <p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

                            <p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: InnoApps, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
                            
                            <p>Legal Requirements: InnoApps may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of InnoApps, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
